			<h2>A bit about myself</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to my website. I am a JSPS Research Fellow at the University of Tokyo in Goda lab, working on FT-CARS bioapplications to vibrational cell cytometry (Nov 2019 - Nov 2021). My main research interest is single-cell biophysics, working in the interface between physics and biochemistry. My goal is to become an established researcher in bioapplications of vibrational spectroscopy. I am currently open to fellowship opportunities for 2022. <br> <br>

				I did my PhD in Physics at the University of Leeds on Raman confocal microspectroscopy and Microfluidics towards a new single-cell analysis system. After this, I did a short project as a Research Assistant on Raman spectroscopy of Oral Biofilms on-a-chip. I am confident with single-cell microscopy techniques, with previous work on single membrane flickering using ultrafast bright field microscopy and Raman spectroscopy and microspectroscopy of single-cells and tissue. <br> <br>

				I have extensive experience in mammalian cell culture, using multiple adherent and non-adherent human cell lines. I also have training on microfluidic devices use and fabrication using Soft lithography Rapid prototyping techniques (SU8 and PDMS) and working in a clean-room environment. <br> <br>

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>
						I am from Spain and was borned in Madrid. After Highschool, I decided I wanted to study in the Complutense University of Madrid and I joined a BsC in Physics. The year after, I joined a BsC in Biochemistry too, and I studied them both simultaneously. I was sure that I wanted to work in Research. In 2012, I obtained the Erasmus Mundus scholarship and moved to Leeds for a year, where I got the chance to join the Molecular and Nanoscale Physics research group (University of Leeds) for a summer research scholarship. Years later, after finishing my BsCs (2015) I started my PhD at the University of Leeds.

					<h3>PhD</h3>
					<p>
						I joined the Molecular and Nanoscale Physics Group in 2015 as a PhD student, and worked on my PhD for the following three and a half years. I focused on Raman spectroscopy bio-applications, learning how to measure live single-cell Raman spectra in a reproducible manner, and the main chemometric tools for its analysis, including Principal Component Analysis, Classification Trees, Linear Discriminat Analysis or Support Vector Machines. I also explored the integration of fluorescence and Raman signals to obtain complementary information (fluoRaman). I also worked on soft litography techniques, Raman spectroscopy in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices and Raman spectroscopy of bacteria and plant samples. I finished my PhD in September 2019.

					<h3>JSPS Fellowship</h3>
					<p>
						At the end of my PhD I secured a standard JSPS fellowship to move to the University of Tokyo, working in Goda Lab. There I joined Hiramatsu's team working on a Fourier Transform Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (FT-CARS) setup to perform high-throughput vibrational flow cytometry. I used microalgae cells as a model system, working mainly with Euglena, Haematococcus and Muriella cells for paramylon, astaxanthin and starch detection respectively.
