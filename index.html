	<h3>Education</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:smaller; font-style: italic;">
		<img src="images/UCM.jpg" width="70%" alt="University Complutense of Madrid picture"><br>
		I studied Physics and Biochemistry at the University Complutense of Madrid (2009-2015).
	</p>
	<p>
		I was born in Madrid, Spain. After High school, I joined a BsC in Physics at the University Complutense of Madrid. A year later, I joined a BsC in Biochemistry, and I studied both BScs simultaneously. In 2012, I obtained the Erasmus Mundus scholarship and moved to Leeds for a year, where I joined the Molecular and Nanoscale Physics research group (University of Leeds) for a summer research scholarship. Years later, after finishing my BsCs (2015) I returned to the University of Leeds for a PhD. <br> <br>

	<h3>PhD</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:smaller; font-style: italic;">
		<img src="images/Julia_lab2.jpg" width="70%" alt="University Complutense of Madrid picture"><br>
		At the University of Leeds, I worked with an integrated confocal fluorescence and Raman microscope.
	</p>
	<p>
		I joined the <a href="https://mnp.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Molecular and Nanoscale Physics Group</a> in 2015 as a PhD student, and worked on my PhD for the following three and a half years. During my PhD, I used Raman spectroscopy for biochemical phenotyping of live single-cells of different stages of colorectal cancer, with the findings published in the <a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrs.5389" target="_blank">Journal of Raman spectroscopy</a> (2018). I also studied the accumulation and photoactivation of a photosensitiser in single colorectal cancer cells, with both Raman and fluorescence (fluoRaman, a term that has been referenced in the literature) and for the single-cell dynamics of the photosensitiser activation using Raman spectroscopy. These findings were published in the Analyst (<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/AN/C8AN01461B" target="_blank">2019</a> and <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/an/d0an01023e" target="_blank">2020</a>). I also became proficient on the main chemometric tools for its analysis, including Principal Component Analysis, Classification Trees, Linear Discriminat Analysis or Support Vector Machines. During my PhD, I also worked with soft lithography microfluidics device fabrication and compatibility with Raman spectroscopy, co-authoring a publication of the Raman analysis of the oil uptake of PDMS in a microfluidic device (<a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs42452-020-03288-8">SN Applied Sciences, 2020</a>). I also collaborated in multiple microfluidic deformation cytometry studies (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349519301043?via%3Dihub">Biophysical Journal 2019</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59952-x" >Scientific Reports 2020</a>). I secured 4 travel grants and a conference bursary, and I was awarded 2 poster prizes (1st and 2nd). I was also invited as a speaker to SPEC2018, and was selected for STEM for Britain to present my research at the British Parliament. For the latter, I granted a BBC Radio Leeds interview. I finished my PhD in September 2019.<br><br>

	<h3>JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship</h3>

		At the end of my PhD I secured a standard JSPS fellowship and a grant-in-a-aid to move to the University of Tokyo, working in <a href="http://www.goda.chem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html" target="_blank">Goda Lab</a> as part of <a href="https://researchmap.jp/cot-hira/?lang=en" target="_blank">Kotaro Hiramatsu's team</a>. This was an exciting opportunity for me to explore non-linear spectroscopy, working on a lab-made Fourier Transform Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering system, as part of Kotaro Hiramatsu's team. We used FT-CARS for high-throughput vibrational flow cytometry and sorting. I published an <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00001" target="_blank">Account</a> on high throughput Raman flow cytometry (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/pb-assets/images/_journalCovers/achre4/achre4_v054i009-2.jpg?0.09609107882782864" target="_blank">journal cover</a>), and co-authored a recently submitted study on high throughput Raman activated cell sorting in the fingerprint region (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.16.444384v1" target="_blank">BioRxiv</a>). I used microalgae cells as a model system, working mainly with Euglena, Haematococcus and Muriella cells for paramylon, astaxanthin and starch detection respectively. DUring this time, I got invited as a speaker to SciX2021 and secured a SAS travel grant.<br><br>

	<h3>Science engagement</h3>

	</p>
	<p>
		I have participated in science engagement events, including events organized by the IoP, the RSC, Pint of Science, STEM for Britain, 
		and SPIE. I also worked with year 12 students at the Physics and Astronomy Work Experience Week, and will be giving a talk in a 
		Japanese high school this September. I was also the Committee Chair of the Serendipity Lab Twitter Workshop and co-chaired the 
		2020 Serendipity Symposium.<br><br>
