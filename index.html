	<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Education</h3>
	<a><img src="images/UCM.jpg" width="70%" alt="University Complutense of Madrid picture" class="center"></a>
	<p>
		I was born in Madrid, Spain. After High school, I joined a BsC in Physics at the University Complutense of Madrid. A year after, 
		I joined a BsC in Biochemistry, and I studied both BScs simultaneously. In 2012, I obtained the Erasmus Mundus scholarship and 
		moved to Leeds for a year, where I joined the Molecular and Nanoscale Physics research group (University of Leeds) for a summer 
		research scholarship. Years later, after finishing my BsCs (2015) I returned to the University of Leeds for a PhD. <br> <br>  
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">PhD</h3>
	<a ><img src="images/Julia_lab2.jpg" width="70%" alt="" class="center"></a>
	<p>
		I joined the Molecular and Nanoscale Physics Group in 2015 as a PhD student, and worked on my PhD for the following three and a 
		half years. During my PhD, I used Raman spectroscopy for biochemical phenotyping of live single-cells of different stages of 
		colorectal cancer, with the findings published in the Journal of Raman spectroscopy (2018). I also studied the accumulation and 
		photoactivation of a photosensitiser in single colorectal cancer cells, with both Raman and fluorescence (fluoRaman, a term that 
		has been referenced in the literature) and for the single-cell dynamics of the photosensitiser activation using Raman spectroscopy. 
		These findings were published in the Analyst (2019 and 2020). I also became proficient on the main chemometric tools for its analysis, 
		including Principal Component Analysis, Classification Trees, Linear Discriminat Analysis or Support Vector Machines. During my PhD, 
		I also worked with soft lithography microfluidics device fabrication and compatibility with Raman spectroscopy, co-authoring a 
		publication of the Raman analysis of the oil uptake of PDMS in a microfluidic device (SN Science Advances, 2020). I also collaborated 
		in multiple microfluidic deformation cytometry studies (Biophysical Journal 2019, Scientific Reports 2020). I secured 4 travel grants 
		and a conference bursary, and I was awarded 2 poster prizes (1st and 2nd). I was also invited as a speaker to SPEC2018, and was selected
		for STEM for Britain to present my research at the British Parliament. For the latter, I granted a BBC Radio Leeds interview.  
		I finished my PhD in September 2019. <br><br>

	<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship</h3>
	<a style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/TeamPhoto2.jpg" width="70%" alt=""></a>
	<p>
		At the end of my PhD I secured a standard JSPS fellowship and a grant-in-a-aid to move to the University of Tokyo, working in Goda Lab.
		This was an exciting opportunity for me to explore non-linear spectroscopy, working on a lab-made Fourier Transform Coherent anti-Stokes 
		Raman scattering system, as part of Kotaro Hiramatsu's team. We used FT-CARS for high-throughput vibrational flow cytometry and sorting. 
		I published an Account on high throughput Raman flow cytometry (journal cover), and co-authored a recently submitted study on high 
		throughput Raman activated cell sorting in the fingerprint region (BioRxiv). I used microalgae cells as a model system, working mainly 
		with Euglena, Haematococcus and Muriella cells for paramylon, astaxanthin and starch detection respectively. DUring this time, I got
		invited as a speaker to SciX2021 and secured a SAS travel grant.<br><br>
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Science engagement</h3>
	<a style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/B50K0668_StephenBen_editedcropped.jpg" width="70%" alt=""></a>
	<p>
		I have participated in science engagement events, including events organized by the IoP, the RSC, Pint of Science, STEM for Britain, 
		and SPIE. I also worked with year 12 students at the Physics and Astronomy Work Experience Week, and will be giving a talk in a 
		Japanese high school this September. I was also the Committee Chair of the Serendipity Lab Twitter Workshop and co-chaired the 
		2020 Serendipity Symposium.<br><br>
